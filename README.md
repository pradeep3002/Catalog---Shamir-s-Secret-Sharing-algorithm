# Catalog---Shamir-s-Secret-Sharing-algorithm
In this code we will solve this simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm
We will go through the first given test cases that are in teh json format and find the constant term i.e, ‘c’ of the polynomial with the given roots.
Later change the test cases with the give example test cases and find.

To run this I used Node.js in the terminal.
